# Color Averaging

Color averaging is the process of calculating an average color from a set of other colors by taking the mean of each
color channel.

Averaging under ColorAide can take as many colors as desired and will return a color that represents the average. This
is not to be confused with interpolation which employs a different technique, but in certain situations, it can sort of
function like mixing multiple colors.

## Rectangular Space Averaging

ColorAide, by default, averages in rectangular color spaces, the default being Linear sRGB. If desired, other color
spaces can be used, such as perceptually uniform spaces like Oklab.

```py play
Color.average(['red', 'blue'])
Color.average(['red', 'blue'], space='srgb')
Color.average(['red', 'blue'], space='oklab')
```

Averaging is not restricted to any certain amount of colors.

```py play
Color.average(['red', 'yellow', 'orange', 'green'])
```

## Cylindrical Space Averaging

ColorAide can average colors in rectangular spaces and cylindrical spaces. When applying averaging in a cylindrical
space, hues will be averaged taking the circular mean.

Cylindrical averaging may not provide as good of results as using rectangular spaces, but is provided to provide a sane
approach if a cylindrical space is used.

```py play
Color.average(['orange', 'yellow', 'red'])
Color.average(['orange', 'yellow', 'red'], space='hsl')
```

Because calculations are done in a cylindrical space, the averaged colors can be different than what is acquired with
rectangular space averaging.

```py play
Color.average(['purple', 'green', 'blue'])
Color.average(['purple', 'green', 'blue'], space='hsl')
```

## Averaging with Transparency

ColorAide, by default, will account for transparency when averaging colors. Colors which are more transparent will have
less of an impact on the average. This is done by premultiplying the colors before averaging.

```py play
Steps([Color('darkgreen'), Color('color(srgb 0 0.50196 0 / 1)'), Color('color(srgb 0 0 1)')])
for i in range(12):
    Color.average(['darkgreen', f'color(srgb 0 0.50196 0 / {i / 11})', 'color(srgb 0 0 1)'])
```

If you'd like to average the channels without taking transparency into consideration, simply set `premultiplied` to
`#!py False`.

```py play
Steps([Color('darkgreen'), Color('color(srgb 0 0.50196 0 / 1)'), Color('color(srgb 0 0 1)')])
for i in range(12):
    Color.average(['darkgreen', f'color(srgb 0 0.50196 0 / {i / 11})', 'color(srgb 0 0 1)'], premultiplied=False)
```

## Averaging with Undefined Values

When averaging with undefined values, ColorAide will not consider the undefined values in the average. This is mainly
provided for averaging cylindrical colors, particularly achromatic colors.

```py play
Color.average(['white', 'color(srgb 0 0 1)'], space='hsl')
```

Implied achromatic hues are only considered undefined if `powerless` is enabled. This is similar to how interpolation
works. By default, explicitly defined hues are respected if working directly in the averaging color space.

```py play
Color.average(['hsl(30 0 100)', 'hsl(240 100 50 / 1)'], space='hsl')
Color.average(['hsl(30 0 100)', 'hsl(240 100 50 / 1)'], space='hsl', powerless=True)
```

While undefined logic is intended to handle achromatic hues, this logic will be applied to any channel. It should be
noted that no attempt to carry forward the undefined values through conversion is made at this time. Conversions will
remove any undefined status unless the channel is an achromatic hues.

```py play
for i in range(12):
    Color.average(['darkgreen', f'color(srgb 0 none 0 / {i / 11})', 'color(srgb 0 0 1)'])
```

When `premultiplied` is enabled, premultiplication will not be applied to a color if its `alpha` is undefined.

```py play
Color.average(['darkgreen', f'color(srgb 0 0.50196 0 / none)', 'color(srgb 0 0 1)'], space='srgb')
```
