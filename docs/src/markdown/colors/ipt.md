Ebner and Fairchild addressed the issue of non-constant lines of hue in their color space dubbed IPT. The IPT color
space converts D65-adapted XYZ data (XD65, YD65, ZD65) to long-medium-short cone response data (LMS) using an adapted
form of the Hunt-Pointer-Estevez matrix (M~HPE~(D65)).

The IPT color appearance model excels at providing a formulation for hue where a constant hue value equals a constant
perceived hue independent of the values of lightness and chroma (which is the general ideal for any color appearance
model, but hard to achieve). It is therefore well-suited for gamut mapping implementations.

**Inputs**

The IPT space is not currently supported in the CSS spec, the parsed input and string output formats use the
`#!css-color color()` function format using the custom name `#!css-color --ipt`:

```css-color
color(--ipt i p t / a)  // Color function
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(--ipt i p t / a)` form.

```playground
Color("ipt", [0.45616, 0.62086, 0.44282])
Color("ipt", [0.64877, 0.189, 0.5303]).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide.spaces.ipt import IPT

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(IPT())
```
