The RLAB color-appearance space was developed by Fairchild and Berns for cross-media color reproduction applications in
which images are reproduced with differing white points, luminance levels, and/or surrounds.

## Input/Output

The RLAB space is not currently supported in the CSS spec, the parsed input and string output formats use the
`#!css-color color()` function format using the custom name `#!css-color --rlab`:

```css-color
color(--rlab l a b / a)  // Color function
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(--rlab l a b / a)` form.

```playground
Color("rlab", [51.012, 79.742, 57.26])
Color("rlab", [72.793, 25.151, 74.11]).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide.spaces.rlab import RLAB

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(RLAB())
```
