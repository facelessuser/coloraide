A color appearance model (CAM) is a mathematical model that seeks to describe the perceptual aspects of human color
vision, i.e. viewing conditions under which the appearance of a color does not tally with the corresponding physical
measurement of the stimulus source.

The CAM16 model is a successor of CIECAM02 with various fixes and improvements. The CAM16 UCS space takes the CAM16
model and applies an additional nonlinear transformation to lightness and colorfulness so that a color difference metric
ΔE can be based more closely on Euclidean distance. The `cam16-ucd` color space in ColorAide is based off CAM16 (Jab)
which uses M (colorfulness) to derive the a and b values. There are also [SCD](./cam16_scd.md) and [LCD](./cam16_lcd.md)
variants which optimize the spaces for "small" and "large" color distancing respectively.

## Viewing Conditions

CAM16 UCS uses the same environment setup for viewing conditions as [CAM16 JMh](./cam16_jmh.md), so check out the
related documentation if creating a CAM16 UCS variant is desired.

## Input/Output

The CAM16 UCS space is not currently supported in the CSS spec, the parsed input and string output formats use
the `#!css-color color()` function format using the custom name `#!css-color --cam16-ucs`:

```css-color
color(--cam16-ucs j a b / a)  // Color function
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(--cam16-ucs j a b / a)` form.

```py play
Color("cam16-ucs", [59.178, 40.82, 21.153], 1)
Color("cam16-ucs", [78.364, 9.6945, 28.629], 1).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide_extras.spaces.cam16_ucs import CAM16UCS

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(CAM16UCS())
```
