A color appearance model (CAM) is a mathematical model that seeks to describe the perceptual aspects of human color
vision, i.e. viewing conditions under which the appearance of a color does not tally with the corresponding physical
measurement of the stimulus source.

CAM16 is a successor of CIECAM02 with various fixes and improvements. The model actually defines numerous different
attributes:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
J    | Lightness
C    | Chroma
h    | hue
s    | saturation
Q    | Brightness
M    | Colorfulness
H    | Hue Quadrature

A color space can be constructed of using a subset of these attributes: JCh, JMh, Jsh, QCh, QMh, Qsh, etc. You can also
construct Lab like spaces taking using the hue and either C, M, or s. The `cam16` color space in ColorAide represents
a Jab configuration based off M (Colorfulness).

## Input/Output

The CAM16 UCS space is not currently supported in the CSS spec, the parsed input and string output formats use
the `#!css-color color()` function format using the custom name `#!css-color --cam16`:

```css-color
color(--cam16 j a b / a)  // Color function
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(--cam16 j a b / a)` form.

```playground
Color("cam16", [46.026, 72.143, 37.385], 1)
Color("cam16", [68.056, 13.955, 41.212], 1).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide_extras.spaces.cam16 import CAM16

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(CAM16())
```

## Subclassing

CAM16 is a color model that can vary due to viewing conditions. Factors such as surround (average/dim/dark), adapting
luminance, background luminance, white point, and whether the eye is assumed to be fully adapted to the illuminant can
all play into how the color model responds.

If it is desired to create a CAM16 variant that uses different viewing conditions, the `CAM16` class can be subclassed.
A new `Environment` object should be set to the class describing the viewing conditions.

When subclassing, always use a new, unique name, like `cam16-custom` as other features or color spaces may depend on the
`cam16` name converting a certain way.
