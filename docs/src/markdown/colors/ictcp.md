Name       | Range^\*^
---------- | ---------
`i`        | [0, 1]
`ct`       | [-0.5, 0.5]
`cp`       | [-0.5, 0.5]

^\*^ Space is not bound to the above, defined range but represents a practical range for HDR color spaces. CSS uses a
range of `i` = [0, 1], `ct` = [-1, 1] and `cp` = [1, 1] for percentage input and output.

ICtCp is a color space format with better perceptual uniformity than [CIELab](#cielab) and is used as a part of the
color image pipeline in video and digital photography systems for high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG)
imagery. It was developed by Dolby Laboratories from the IPT color space by Ebner and Fairchild. It was designed with
the intention to replace YCbCr.

## Input/Output

Parsed input and string output formats support all valid CSS forms:

```css-color
color(ictcp i ct cp / a)  // Color function
```

When manually creating a color via raw data or specifying a color space as a parameter in a function, the color
space name is always used:

```py
Color("ictcp", [0, 0, 0], 1)
```

The string representation of the color object and the default string output use the
`#!css-color color(ictcp i ct cp / a)` form.

```py play
Color("ictcp", [0.42785, -0.11574, 0.2788])
Color("ictcp", [0.50497, -0.20797, 0.11077]).to_string()
```

## Registering

```py
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide.spaces.ictcp import ICtCp

class Color(Base): ...

Color.register(ICtCp())
```
