# Manipulating Colors

Once a `#!py3 Color` object is created, you have access to all the color channels. Color channels can be read
individually or extracted all at once. Getting and setting color channels is flexible and easy, allowing for intuitive
access.

## Accessing Coordinates

There are various ways to get and set the current values of color coordinates. Colors can be accessed by channel name
or numerical index directly. We can also manipulate colors within different color spaces.

### Access By Channel Name

One of the more intuitive ways to access color values is by channel name. Each color space defines the name of each of
the available channels. `alpha` is the one channel name that is always constant no matter the color space.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color['r']
color['g']
color['b']
color['alpha']
```

Some channels may be also be recognized using an alias. Check the color space's documentation to learn the recognized
channel names and aliases.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color['red'] = 0
color['green'] = 0
color['blue'] = 1
color
```

### Access By Index

Color channels can also be read or set by index. Channels are always in logical order. This means, for instance, an
RGB color space will have its channel in the order of `r`, `g`, `b`, and `alpha`. The`alpha` channel always being the
last channel in any color space. Check out the color space's documentation to learn more about available channels and
the order in which they are stored.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color[0]
color[1]
color[2]
color[3]
```

Because a Color object essentially operates similar to a list, negative values are also allowed.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color[-1] = 0.5
color
```

### Access By Iteration

Color objects can also be treated as an iterable object. This allows us to simply loop through the values.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
[c for c in color]
```

### Access By Slicing

As previously mentioned, Color objects operate very similar to lists, and as such, can also be read or set via slicing.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color[:-1]
color[:-1] = [0, 0, 1]
color
```

### Access by Type

/// new | New 2.0
///

When dealing with colors, you have two types of channels: color channels and an alpha channel. These values can be
accessed and separated by [slicing](#access-by-slicing) as mentioned earlier, but some convenience functions have
been added to make this easier. `coords()` and `alpha()` will retrieve the color channels and the alpha channel
respectively.

```py play
color = Color("srgb", [1, 0, 1], 0.5)
color
color.alpha()
color.coords()
```

In addition, both of these functions offer a special parameter `nans` that controls whether undefined values are
returned as specified or whether they are resolved to defined values.

```py play
color = Color("hsl", [NaN, 0, 0.75], 0.5)
color
color.coords()
color.coords(nans=False)
```

### Access By Functions

Colors can also be accessed and modified in more advanced ways with special access functions `get()` and `set()`.

`get()` provides access to any channel via the channel name for a given color space, but what sets it apart from other
channel access methods is that it can indirectly access channels in other color spaces as well.

```py play
color = Color("pink")
color
color.get('red')
color.get('oklch.hue')
```

Numerical values for channels can be used as well, but the input should still be a string.

```py play
color = Color("pink")
color
color.get('0')
color.get('oklch.0')
```

/// new | New in 2.14
Parsing numerical representations of channels is new in 2.14
///

Like `get()`, `set()` is a method that allows for the setting of any color channel via the color channel names. The
value can be set via numerical values or functions with more complex logic.

```py play
color = Color("pink")
color
color.set('blue', 0.5)
color.set('green', lambda g: g * 1.3)
color.set('2', 0.0)
```

Since `set()` returns a reference to the current color object, we can also chain multiple `set()` operations.

```py play
color = Color('black')
color
color.set('red', 1).set('green', 1)
```

Even more interesting is that, like `get()`, you can modify a channel in another color space indirectly.

```py play
color = Color("orange")
color
color.set('oklab.lightness', 0.50)
color.set('oklab.0', 0.2)
```

When getting/setting a color channel in a different color space than the current color space, the underlying color must
be converted to the target color space in order to access the channel. When doing this to get/set multiple channels,
this can be a bit inefficient. In order to make such operations more efficient, both `get()` and `set()` allow for bulk
operations. When performing bulk channel operations, the channels operations are performed in the order they are
specified; therefore, it is important to group together channels of the same color space to ensure they are accessed
with a single conversion.

To get multiple channels, simply provide a list of channels.

```py play
color = Color('orange')
color
color.get(['oklch.lightness', 'oklch.hue', 'alpha'])
```

To set multiple channels, pass a single dictionary containing the channel names and values.

```py play
color = Color('orange')
color
color.set(
    {
        'oklch.lightness': lambda l: l - l * 0.25,
        'oklch.hue': 270
    }
)
```

/// warning | Indirect Channel Modifications
Indirect channel modification is very useful, but keep in mind that it may give you access to color spaces that are
incompatible due to gamut size. Additionally, the feature converts the color to the target color space, modifies it,
and then converts it back making it susceptible to any possible [round trip errors](./advanced.md#round-trip-accuracy).

## Undefined Values

Colors can sometimes have undefined channels. This can actually happen in a number of ways. In almost all cases,
undefined values are generated or manually inserted in order to help out with [interpolation](./interpolation.md).

1. Hues can naturally become undefined if the color is [achromatic](#normalizing-achromatic-colors).

    ```py play
    color = Color('white').convert('hsl')
    color[:]
    ```

2. When specifying raw data, channels can be explicitly set to undefined, and when an insufficient amount of channel
   data is provided, the missing channels will be assumed as undefined, the exception is the `alpha` channel which is
   assumed to be `1` unless explicitly defined or explicitly set as undefined.

    ```py play
    Color('srgb', [1])[:]
    Color('srgb', [1, 0, 0], NaN)[:]
    ```

3. Undefined values can also occur when a user specifies a channel with the `none` keyword in CSS syntax.

    ```py play
    from coloraide import NaN
    color = Color("srgb", [0.3, NaN, 0.4])
    color[:]

    color = Color('rgb(30% none 40%)')
    color[:]
    ```

4. Lastly, a user can use the `mask` method which is a quick way to set one or multiple channels as undefined.
   Additionally, it returns a clone leaving the original untouched by default.

    ```py play
    Color('white')[:]
    Color('white').mask(['red', 'green'])[:]
    ```

    The `alpha` channel can also be masked:

    ```py play
    Color('white').mask('alpha')[-1]
    ```

    You can also do inverse masks, or masks that apply to every channel not specified.

    ```py play
    c = Color('white').mask('blue', invert=True)
    c[:]
    ```

### Checking for Undefined Values

As [previously mentioned](#undefined-values), a color channel can be undefined for a number of reasons. And in cases
such as [interpolation](./interpolation.md), undefined values can even be useful. On the other hand, sometimes knowing
there is an undefined value or being able to ignore it can be useful.

Undefined values are represented as the float value `NaN`. And since `NaN` values are not numbers -- hence the name "not
a number" -- they don't quite work the same as normal numbers. They don't contribute to math operations like add,
multiply, and divide. Any math operation performed with a `NaN` will simply yield `NaN`. `NaN` values are essentially
infectious.

At first glance, the behavior of `NaN` values can seem confusing, but it is actually pretty intuitive. If we define a
color with an undefined channel, and try to add to that value, what should we get? In reality, if the value is
undefined, how could we possibly add to it? The only sane answer is to return `NaN` again.

```py play
color = Color('color(srgb 1 none 1)')
color['green'] + 0.5
```

Because a `NaN` (or undefined value) may cause surprising results, it can be useful to check if a hue (or any channel)
is undefined before applying certain operations where such a value may be undesirable, especially if the color
potentially came from an unknown source. To make checking for undefined values easy, the convenience function
`is_nan` has been made available. You can simply give `is_nan` the property you wish to check, and it will return
either `#!py3 True` or `#!py3 False`.

```py play
Color('hsl(none 0% 100%)').is_nan('hue')
```

This is equivalent to using the `math` library and comparing the value directly:

```py play
import math
math.isnan(Color('hsl(none 0% 100%)')['hue'])
```
### Forcing Defined Values

Another way to deal with `NaN` values is to just ignore them. `get()`, `set()`, `coords()`, and `alpha()` all can use
the `nans` option to ensure read operations return a defined value.

```py play
c = Color('srgb', [])
c
c.get('red', nans=False)
c.set('green', lambda x: x + 3, nans=False)
```

/// note | `set()`
In the context of `set()`, `nans` specifically ensures that when a callback function is provided that the input value
is transformed into a real value opposed to an undefined value.
///

We can also use `normalize()` to just set all channels to defined values, but keep mind, when an
[achromatic color](#achromatic-colors) has a real hue, they will then influence interpolation results if interpolating
in that same color space.

```py play
c = Color('srgb', [])
c.normalize(nans=False)
```

### How are Undefined Values Resolved?

ColorAide will resolve undefined values when necessary. Resolving undefined values may be needed to compute color
distance, convert a color, serialize a color, or various other reasons.

Normally, an undefined value defaults to `0` when forced to be defined, but there are a few cases where this may not
always be true.

1.  When a color is achromatic the hue becomes meaningless in most cylindrical color spaces. This makes sense as
    achromatic colors have no hues, but this is also because the algorithms usually work out this way. When chroma is
    small enough, it usually makes the hue mathematically insignificant. In these cases, when a hue must be defined, we
    will generally assume `0` as an arbitrary default, but there are some color spaces who have algorithms where the hue
    actually becomes more important for precise conversions.

    The color spaces CAM16 JMh and HCT are color models that allow you to set the viewing environment. One of the
    options determines whether the eye is adapted to the illuminant or not. If not adapted, which is our default for
    both CAM16 JMh and HCT, you can get an achromatic response where grayscale colors lean heavily into one specific
    hue. Additionally, achromatic chroma may grow to a value much greater than `0` as lightness increases. If we were
    to use `0` as a default for chroma and/or hue, we'd actually not convert back to a real achromatic color.

    We can see in the example below that using `0` for an undefined hue in CAM16 JMh will not convert `#!py gray` back
    to sRGB properly, but using the one calculated for the color space gets us much closer.

    ```py play
    srgb = Color('gray')
    srgb
    jmh = srgb.convert('cam16-jmh')
    jmh.coords(nans=False)
    jmh.convert('srgb')
    jmh.set('hue', 0).convert('srgb')
    ```

    For color spaces with more dynamic achromatic response, ColorAide will resolve undefined hues and chroma with real
    values that are neutral for that color's given lightness. This doesn't just apply to cylindrical spaces either.
    This behavior can be seen in non cylindrical spaces as well, like the Lab form of CAM16.

    ```py play
    Color('gray').convert('cam16-ucs')
    Color('cam16-ucs', [56.23, NaN, NaN]).normalize(nans=False)
    ```

    The selected values may not always perfectly precise, but they are much better than blindly assuming zero.

    There are a number of spaces that benefit from this approach: Jzazbz/JzCzhz, IPT, IgPgTg.

2.  Most of the time, if you set all color channels to undefined, when resolved, the color will be black (or white in
    the case of CMYK). Unfortunately, using `0` for undefined channels in some color spaces can create colors outside
    the viewable gamut. One such example is ACEScct (a logarithmic encoding of ACES) which has a greater value than zero
    for black. In this case, setting undefined channels to zero will cause nonsense colors. In this specific case, we
    use ACEScct's value for black instead of `0` for more a more practical default.

    ```py play
    aces = Color('black').convert('acescct')
    aces
    aces.mask(['alpha'], invert=True, in_place=True)
    aces.coords(nans=False)
    aces.in_gamut()
    aces[:] = [0] * 3
    aces.in_gamut()
    ```

    /// new | New 2.3
    ACEScc, another color space that performs a logarithmic encoding of ACES, will also resolve undefined channels to a
    non-zero value, not because zero is out of gamut, but to ensure consistency across all ACES color spaces which
    resolve to zero or non-zero equivalent values.
    ///

## Achromatic Colors

An achromatic color is a color without any real hue. Essentially, it is devoid of color leaving only shades of gray.
Different color spaces represent achromatic colors in different ways.

ColorAide has some special handling of achromatic colors and a few ways to test if a color is achromatic.

### Checking For Achromatic Colors

/// new | New 2.0
///

ColorAide generally respects an input color's defined channels, but during conversion, or if `normalize()` is called,
cylindrical color spaces will have their hue set to undefined if the color is achromatic (or very close to achromatic).
One easy way to check for achromatic colors is simply to check if the hue is undefined with `is_nan()`.

```py play
c = Color('gray').convert('hsl')
c.is_nan('hue')
```

Unfortunately, this assumes that the `hue` has not been manually altered and this doesn't work with non cylindrical
colors. Luckily, ColorAide has a universal way to check if any color is achromatic by using `is_achromatic()`.

```py play
color1 = Color('orange')
color1
color1.is_achromatic()
color2 = Color('gray').convert('lab')
color2
color2.is_achromatic()
color3 = Color('darkgray').convert('hsl').set('hue', 270)
color3
color3.is_achromatic()
```

`is_achromatic()` tries to use a reasonable threshold to determine achromatic colors. The method used is usually
specific to the color space as it is fastest to test in the color space being evaluated.

### Normalizing Achromatic Colors

When ColorAide converts to a cylindrical color, if the color is achromatic, the hue will get set as undefined. This is
mainly because when a color gets very close to achromatic, the hues can become nonsensical. Many cylindrical spaces, as
chroma (or saturation) approaches zero, the color approaches being achromatic. And as chroma gets smaller, the impact of
the hue becomes smaller and smaller. In these cases, when we get very close to achromatic, we
don't care what the hue is, so it gets set as undefined. Additionally, having hue set to undefined allows us to
interpolate achromatic colors in a sane way, see [Interpolation](./interpolation.md) for more info.

There are times that a color can be defined such that it is not in this normalized achromatic state. We can manually
define a color not in this state, and we can also force a color out of this state.

Here we can disable the normalization when converting. We can do this with `convert()` and `update()`

```py play
Color('white').convert('lch')
Color('white').convert('lch', norm=False)
```

We can also remove the normalization by setting `nans` to `#!py False` when using `normalize()`.

```py play
Color('white').convert('lch').normalize(nans=False)
```

If we want to force a color back into this normalized state, we can just call `normalize()` without any parameters.
Normalize will remove any existing undefined channels and set achromatic hues to undefined.

```py play
c = Color('lch', [1, 0, 0])
c
c.normalize()
```
