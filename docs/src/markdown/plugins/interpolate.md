# Interpolation

## Description

Interpolation plugins allow for interpolation between one or more colors. All interpolation in ColorAide is provided via
plugins.

## Plugin Class

Plugins are are created by subclassing `#!py3 coloraide.interpolate.Interpolate`.

```py
class Interpolate(Plugin, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Interpolation plugin."""

    NAME = ""

    @abstractmethod
    def interpolator(
        self,
        coordinates: List[Vector],
        channel_names: Sequence[str],
        create: Type['Color'],
        easings: List[Optional[Callable[..., float]]],
        stops: Dict[int, float],
        space: str,
        out_space: str,
        progress: Optional[Union[Mapping[str, Callable[..., float]], Callable[..., float]]],
        premultiplied: bool,
        **kwargs: Any
    ) -> Interpolator:
        """Get the interpolator object."""
```

Once registered, the plugin can then be used via `interpolate`, `steps`, or `mix` by passing its `NAME` via the `method`
parameter along with any additional key word arguments to override default behavior. An `Interpolator` object will be
returned which allows for interpolating between the given list of `colors`.

```py
color.interpolate(colors, method=NAME)
```

In general, the `Interpolate` plugin is mainly a wrapper to ensure the interpolation setup uses an appropriate
`Interpolator` object which does the actual work. An interpolation plugin should derive their `Interpolator` class from
`coloraide.interpolate.Interpolator`. While we won't show all the methods of the class, we will show the one function
that must be defined.

```py
class Interpolator(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Interpolator."""

    def setup(self) --> None:
        """Setup."""

    @abstractmethod
    def interpolate(
        self,
        easing: Optional[Union[Mapping[str, Callable[..., float]], Callable[..., float]]],
        point: float,
        index: int,
    ) -> Vector:
        """Interpolate."""
```

`Interpolator.interpolate` expects an optional `easing` method that can be either a callback, or a dictionary of
easing functions for specific color channels. Additionally, it accepts a user defined `point` indicating where between
the colors the user is requesting the new color and the `index`, within the list of colors to be interpolated,
of the color to the right of the `point`. The function should return the interpolated coordinates for the color.

Additionally, an optional `Interpolator.setup` method is provided to allow for any additional setup required.
Premultiplication is usually done in `setup` ahead of time. Resolution of undefined values can be recalculated here
as well as it is usually needed so that premultiplication can be done on coordinates that contain undefined values.
With that said, such calculations can also be deferred and handled on the fly if desired.
