    Usage Guidelines for CIECAM97s (Nathan Moroney)

    `white`: This is the (x, y) chromaticity points for the white point. This should be the same
        value as set in the color class `WHITE` value.

    `adapting_luminance`: This is the luminance of the adapting field. The units are in cd/m2.
        The equation is `L = (E * R) / π`, where `E` is the illuminance in lux, `R` is the reflectance,
        and `L` is the luminance. If we assume a perfectly reflecting diffuser, `R` is assumed as 1.
        For the "gray world" assumption, we must also divide by 5 (or multiply by 0.2 - 20%).
        This results in `La = E / π * 0.2`. You can also ignore this gray world assumption converting
        lux directly to nits (cd/m2) `lux / π`.

    `background_luminance`: The background is the region immediately surrounding the stimulus and
        for images is the neighboring portion of the image. Generally, this value is set to a value of 20.
        This implicitly assumes a gray world assumption.

    `surround`: The surround is categorical and is defined based on the relationship between the relative
        luminance of the surround and the luminance of the scene or image white. While there are 4 defined
        surrounds, usually just `average`, `dim`, and `dark` are used.

        Dark    | 0%        | Viewing film projected in a dark room
        Dim     | 0% to 20% | Viewing television
        Average | > 20%     | Viewing surface colors

    `discounting`: Whether we are discounting the illuminance. Done when eye is assumed to be fully adapted.
