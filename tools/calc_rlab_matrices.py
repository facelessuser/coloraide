There was some conflicting info between the two papers. One cited M one way, and one cited the inverse.
One was clearly a mistake. It seems that the `imaging.org` one is the correct M. We ended up implementing
the "Refinement of the RLAB Color Space" algorithm and just replaced M with the correct one.

We did recalculate R for our white point to get a nice, clean transform.
